Hey <%= @mentor.user.first_name %>,
</p>
<p>
We're really sorry to say that your call scheduled on <%= @call_request.scheduled_date %> has been cancelled. The other party can no longer attend and had to cancel.
</p>
<p>
We truly hope you can find someone else on Shyne that can offer helpful advice.
</p>
<p>
Sincerely, <br />
The Shyne Team
