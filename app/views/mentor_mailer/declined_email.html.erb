<h1>Hey <%= @mentor.first_name %>,</h1>
<p>
  We're excited that you’ve shown interest in Shyne, but at this time we’re unable to approve your application to be a mentor on our network. This could be for a variety of reasons, so please don’t take it personally – we encourage people to re-apply to become mentors on Shyne about every 3 months.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br/>
  Shyne Team
