            <p><b>How does Shyne work?</b></p>
            <p>Shyne is a marketplace filled with Advisors and Members. Advisors are people who work at top-tier companies, and Members are people who are looking for quick career advice from Advisors. Members can schedule a 20, 30, or 40-minute call with any of the Advisors for personalized advice over the phone.</p>

            <p><b>What are some ways that I would benefit from using Shyne?</b></p>
            <p>A few examples would be: if you’d like to know what it’s like to work at a particular company, if you need advice on how to achieve a certain position, or if you’d simply like to pick the brain of someone whose career you admire and would like to learn more about.</p>

            <p><b>What countries is Shyne available in?</b></p>
            <p>We are currently in Beta, and only available in the US. We do have plans to expand internationally down the line though.</p>

            <p><b>Can I use Shyne to get referrals into companies that I’m interested in?</b></p>
            <p>Shyne is not a paid-referral service, and Members who ask Advisors for a referral will unfortunately have their calls cut short. We want all of our Advisors to feel comfortable giving career advice in a positive and helpful manner, and simply asking for referrals is not what Shyne is meant for.</p>

            <p><b>How do I start?</b></p>
            <p>It’s free to create an account, and you can decide whether you’d like to become a Member or if you’d like to apply to become an Advisor. We’re always looking for more Advisors that work at top-tier companies and want to offer a helping hand!</p>

            <p><b>How do calls get setup? Are there any privacy concerns?</b></p>
            <p>Whenever a call is confirmed, we provide both parties with a conference line to dial at the time of the call. Your cell phone number and email address will always be hidden, and your phone will never be dialed by anyone on our system.</p>

            <p><b>How much does it cost to use Shyne?</b></p>
            <p>Shyne is free to join for both Advisors and Members. Members only pay a fee when they would like to schedule a call with an Advisor.</p>
            <div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>

            <p><b>How does Shyne process payments?</b></p>
            <p>Shyne uses Balanced Payments (<a href='https://www.balancedpayments.com/' target="_blank">www.balancedpayments.com</a>) to handle the processing of all credit card transactions. If you are a Member trying to schedule a call with an Advisor, your credit card will not be charged until after the call is complete.</p>
            <div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>

            <p><b>How does Shyne deposit payments for Advisors?</b></p>
            <p>After Advisors take their first calls, Shyne asks for bank account information in order to deposit the funds automatically. The bank account deposits are handled via our third party payment processor (<a href='https://www.balancedpayments.com/' target="_blank">www.balancedpayments.com</a>).</p>
            <div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>

            <p><b>What are Shyne’s fees for Advisors?</b></p>
            <p>Shyne currently takes 30% of the Advisor’s revenue before depositing the funds into the Advisor’s bank account.</p>
            <div class="cl">&nbsp;</div>

            <p><b>What is your refund policy for Members?</b></p>
            <p>100% guaranteed if not satisfied. If you are a Member and are unhappy with the career advice received, simply send us an email at <a href='mailto:admin@shyne.io'>admin@shyne.io</a> and we will automatically give you a refund, no questions asked.</p>
