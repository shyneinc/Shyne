          <div class="col-md-12">
            <div class="mission-text">We believe that career development is extremely unfair.  And that it’s time for someone to step up and help everyone have an equal opportunity to get on the path to land their dream job.</div>
            <div class="mission-text">We’ve all heard the phrase “It’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know.” But what about all the hard-working, intelligent people who simply don’t have a strong network to receive the best advice? Should their careers be limited by something as trivial as how big their network is? People who are lucky enough to have Mentors in their lives get better career advice, more interview tips, and a stronger chance of finding success sooner.</div>
            <div class="mission-text">Here at Shyne, our mission is simple: give everyone an equal opportunity to obtain the mentorship they need to maximize their skill set in order to accelerate their careers. We have Mentors on our site who work at some of the biggest firms in the US. Using our platform, you can schedule calls with them and pay them for their time. How long you’d like to speak with someone is entirely up to you – you can schedule a 20, 30, or 40-miute call depending on your needs.</div>
            <div class="mission-text">We created this company for those who feel stuck in their career and are lost on how to utilize their skills to get the next step. We also want to help the unemployed find a way to get on the path to working on something they’re truly interested in. If you’re unhappy at your job, or currently unemployed, or just need a helping hand on figuring out how to land your dream job, we’re confident we have a solution for you.</div>
            <div><span>Cheers.</span></div>
