            <p>We believe that career development is extremely unfair.  And that it’s time for someone to step up and help everyone have an equal opportunity to land their dream job.</p>
            <p>We’ve all heard the phrase “It’s not about what you know, it’s about who you know.” But what about all the hard-working, intelligent people who simply don’t have a strong network to receive the best advice? Should their careers be limited just because they have a smaller network? People who are lucky enough to have Mentors in their lives get better career advice, more interview tips, and a stronger chance of finding success sooner.</p>
            <p>Here at Shyne, our mission is simple: give everyone an equal opportunity to obtain the mentorship they need to maximize their careers. We have Mentors on our site who work at some of the biggest firms in the US. Using our platform, you can schedule calls with them and pay them for their time. How long you’d like to speak with someone is entirely up to you &ndash; you can schedule a 20, 30, or 40-minute call depending on your needs.</p>
            <p>We created this company for those who feel stuck in their career and are lost on how to utilize their skills to get the next step. We also want to help the unemployed land a position that they’re truly passionate about. Whether you’re unemployed, unhappy at your current job, or just need a helping hand, we’re confident we have a solution for you.</p>
            <p>Cheers,<br>The Shyne Team</p>
